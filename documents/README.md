Premier League Scores App

For my project I am planning on writing an app that displays scores for Premier
League (English soccer) fixtures. The idea would be that the user could open the
app and see live score updates as well as historical scores or all fixtures.
Additionally, the user would be able to sort by team to only see that team's fixtures.

I want to build this because I am a huge soccer (football) fan, and it would be
a concise tool to go straight to the scores, rather than using the Premier League
app which contains a large amount of info to sift through.

This is an API I am considering using:
