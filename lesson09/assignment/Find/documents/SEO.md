SEO and Analytics:

SEO is a way to format a site to hopefully appear higher up in user searches. One way to increase SEO on a site is to including only one H1 tag per page and featuring the most important information in that H1 tag. A crawler will look for H1 tags, then work its way down to H6 tags. Another way to increase an SEO score is to link to quality sites with good content. Additionally, if other sites link to your site, this also helps increase SEO. Something to avoid is adding ghost pages or hidden text to improve SEO. This will not work and will in fact negatively affect your SEO.

A couple analytics tools to measure user visits and behavior are Google Analytics and Heat Maps. Google Analytics measures many user behaviors, some of which include who visits your site, what they click on, session duration, pages per session and “bounce rate” (percentage of visitors who enter a site then leave rather than continuing to view other pages on the site). Heat maps are used to trace where a user moves their cursor, telling the site owner what content is seen most vs. least.


Ideal Implementation of SEO on my site:

- limit H1 tags to one per page and including the most important information in those H1 tags
- add comprehensive alt text to images
- ensuring each page on my site has its own unique and relevant metadata
- test the loading speed of my site and remove anything that hinders that
- link to other reputable sites from my site
- include systems such as Google Analytics as early as possible
- write good content that engages users, rather than caters to a robot search engine
- use A/B testing as soon as possible, and whenever something on the site is changed, measure the success of that change via A/B testing


Learnings from Moz article "Hypothesis Testing in SEO & Statistical Significance":

The most important part of A/B testing is having a strong hypothesis.
There are four main steps of hypothesis testing:

1. Formulate a hypothesis:
	With SEO we are looking to impact three things to increase organic traffic:
	- Improve organic click-through rates
	- Improve organic ranking
	- Rank for more keywords

2. Collect data:
	- Split pages up into statistically similar buckets
	- A/B test with control and variant
	- Observe if the difference is a positive or negative change
	- Look for a statistically significant test where all data is either trending positive or all trending 	negative

3. Analyze the data:
	- “We’re doing business not science”, so sometimes it is okay to run a test that was not 	statistically significant based on how strong or weak the hypothesis is and how cheap or 	expensive it would be to make the change

4. Draw some conclusions:
	- With hypothesis testing, trying to test the null hypothesis
	- A null result does not mean there was no effect at all
	- A null result means can’t accept or reject the hypothesis - it was too random to say if it is true 	or false
