The space is shared with a coffee shop and a sandwich shop, so you could really spend the whole day there if you wanted. They have a large selection of beer on tap and to-go. One of my favorites is their Life Jacket Citrus IPA. It has a lower alcohol content so you shouldn’t have a problem drinking a couple."

Every day brings a different food truck parked outside so you can grab a little bite to accompany your beverage. Did I mention their head brewer is a chemist? Also, one of their owners was the first woman in Washington to become a certified cicerone (the equivalent of a beer sommelier)! Those facts, along with some fantastic beer, are more than enough reasons to check this brewery out.  One of my favorites is their Northwest Red Ale.'
